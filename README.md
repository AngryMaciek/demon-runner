# _demon-runner_

Demon (deme-based oncology model) is a flexible framework for modelling intra-tumour population genetics with varied spatial structures and modes of cell dispersal.  
The following repository encapsulates demon into an automated and reproducible [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow in order to simplify parallel simulations to all users.
